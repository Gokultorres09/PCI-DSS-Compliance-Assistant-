  "3.5": ". However, encryption alone is generally insufficient to render the cardholder data out of scope for PCI DSS and does not\nremove the need for PCI DSS in that environment. The entity\u2019s environment is still in scope for PCI DSS due to the presence of cardholder\ndata. For example, for a merchant card-present environment, there is physical access to the payment cards to complete a transaction and\nthere may also be paper reports or receipts with cardholder data. Similarly, in merchant card-not-present environments, such as mail-\norder/telephone-order and e-commerce, payment card details are provided via channels that need to be evaluated and protected according to\nPCI DSS.\nThe following are each in scope for PCI DSS:\n\uf0a7 Systems performing encryption and/or decryption of cardholder data, and systems performing key management functions,\n\uf0a7 Encrypted cardholder data that is not isolated from the encryption and decryption and key management processes,\nPayment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0.1 June 2024\n\u00a92006 - 2024 PCI Security Standards Council, LLC. All Rights Reserved. Page 14\n\uf0a7 Encrypted cardholder data that is present on a system or media that also contains the decryption key,\n\uf0a7 Encrypted cardholder data that is present in the same environment as the decryption key,\n\uf0a7 Encrypted cardholder data that is accessible to an entity that also has access to the decryption key.\nNote: A PCI-listed P2PE solution can significantly reduce the number of PCI DSS requirements applicable to a merchant\u2019s cardholder data\nenvironment. However, it does not completely remove the applicability of PCI DSS in the merchant environment.\nEncrypted Cardholder Data and Impact to PCI DSS Scope for Third-Party Service Providers\nWhere a third-party service provider (TPSP) receives and/or stores only data encrypted by another entity, and where they do not have the\nability to decrypt the data, the TPSP may be able to consider the encrypted data out of scope if certain conditions are met. This is because\nresponsibility for the data generally remains with the entity, or entities, with the ability to decrypt the data or impact the security of the\nencrypted data. Determining which party is responsible for specific PCI DSS controls will depend on several factors, including who has access\nto the decryption keys, the role performed by each party, and the agreement between parties. Responsibilities should be clearly defined and\ndocumented to ensure both the TPSP and the entity providing the encrypted data understand which entity is responsible for which security\ncontrols.\nAs an example, a TPSP providing storage services receives and stores encrypted cardholder data provided by customers for back-up\npurposes. This TPSP does not have access to the encryption or decryption keys, nor does it perform any key management for its customers.\nThe TPSP can exclude any such encrypted data when determining its PCI DSS scope. However, the TPSP does maintain responsibility for\ncontrolling access to the encrypted data storage as part of its service agreements with its customers.\nResponsibility for ensuring that the encrypted data and the cryptographic keys are protected according to applicable PCI DSS requirements is\noften shared between entities. In the above example, the customer determines which of their personnel are authorized to access the storage\nmedia, and the storage facility is responsible for managing the physical and/or logical access controls to ensure that only persons authorized\nby the customer are granted access to the storage media. The specific PCI DSS requirements applicable to a TPSP will depend on the\nservices provided and the agreement between the two parties. In the example of a TPSP providing storage services, the physical and logical\naccess controls provided by the TPSP will need to be reviewed at least annually. This review could be performed as part of the merchant\u2019s\nPCI DSS assessment or, alternatively, the review could be performed, and controls validated, by the TPSP with appropriate evidence provided\nto the merchant. For information about \u201cappropriate evidence,\u201d see Options for TPSPs to Validate PCI DSS Compliance for TPSP Services\nthat Meet Customers\u2019 PCI DSS Requirements.\nAs another example, a TPSP that receives only encrypted cardholder data for the purposes of routing to other entities, and that does not have\naccess to the data or cryptographic keys, may not have any PCI DSS responsibility for that encrypted data. In this scenario, where the TPSP\nis not providing any security services or access controls, they may be considered the same as a public or untrusted network, and it would be\nthe responsibility of the entity(s) sending/receiving account data through the TPSP\u2019s network to ensure PCI DSS controls are applied to\nprotect the data being transmitted.\nPayment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0.1 June 2024\n\u00a92006 - 2024 PCI Security Standards Council, LLC. All Rights Reserved. Page 15\nUse of Third-Party Service Providers\nAn entity (referred to as the \u201ccustomer\u201d in this section) might choose to use a third-party service provider (TPSP) to store, process, or transmit\naccount data or to manage in-scope system components on the customer\u2019s behalf. Use of a TPSP may have an impact on the security of a\ncustomer\u2019s CDE.\nNote: Use of a PCI DSS compliant TPSP does not make a customer PCI DSS compliant, nor does it remove the customer\u2019s responsibility for\nits own PCI DSS compliance. Even if a customer uses a TPSP, that customer remains responsible for confirming its own compliance as\nrequested by organizations that manage compliance programs (for example, payment brands and acquirers).

Meet the intent and rigor of the original PCI DSS requirement.\n2. Provide a similar level of defense as the original PCI DSS requirement, such that the compensating control sufficiently offsets the risk\nthat the original PCI DSS requirement was designed to defend against. To understand the intent of a requirement, see the Customized\nApproach Objective for most PCI DSS requirements. If a requirement is not eligible for the Customized Approach and therefore does not\nhave a Customized Approach Objective, refer to the Purpose in the Guidance column for that requirement.\n3. Be \u201cabove and beyond\u201d other PCI DSS requirements. (Simply being in compliance with other PCI DSS requirements is not a\ncompensating control.)\n4. When evaluating \u201cabove and beyond\u201d for compensating controls, consider the following:\na) Existing PCI DSS requirements CANNOT be considered as compensating controls if they are already required for the item under\nreview. For example, passwords for non-console administrative access must be sent\nencrypted to mitigate the risk of intercepting cleartext administrative passwords. An entity Note: All compensating controls\ncannot use other PCI DSS password requirements (intruder lockout, complex passwords, must be reviewed and validated for\netc.) to compensate for lack of encrypted passwords, since those other password sufficiency by the assessor who\nrequirements do not mitigate the risk of interception of cleartext passwords.

A compensating control cannot address a requirement that was missed in the past\n(for example, where performance of a task was required two quarters ago, but that task was not performed).\nThe assessor is required to thoroughly evaluate compensating controls during each annual PCI DSS assessment to confirm that each\ncompensating control adequately addresses the risk that the original PCI DSS requirement was designed to address, per items 1-6 above.\nTo maintain compliance, processes and controls must be in place to ensure compensating controls remain effective after the assessment is\ncomplete. Additionally, compensating control results must be documented in the applicable report for the assessment (for example, a Report\non Compliance or a Self-Assessment Questionnaire) in the corresponding PCI DSS requirement section, and included when the applicable\nreport is submitted to the requesting organization.\nPayment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0.1 June 2024\n\u00a9 2006 - 2024 PCI Security Standards Council, LLC.

In\naddition, multi-tenant service providers must meet the requirements in this Appendix.\nMulti-tenant service providers are a type of third-party service provider that offers various shared services to merchants and other service providers, where\ncustomers share system resources (such as physical or virtual servers), infrastructure, applications (including Software as a Service (SaaS)), and/or databases.\nServices may include, but are not limited to, hosting multiple entities on a single shared server, providing e-commerce and/or \u201cshopping cart\u201d services, web-\nbased hosting services, payment applications, various cloud applications and services, and payment gateway and processor services offered in a shared\nenvironment.\nService providers that provide only shared data center services (often called co-location or \u201cco-lo\u201d providers), where equipment, space, and bandwidth are\navailable on a rental basis, are not considered multi-tenant service providers for purposes of this Appendix.\nNote: Even though a multi-tenant service provider may meet these requirements, each customer is still responsible to comply with the PCI DSS requirements\nthat are applicable to its environment and validate compliance as applicable. Often, there are PCI DSS requirements for which responsibility is shared between\nthe provider and the customer (for perhaps different aspects of the environment). Requirements 12.8 and 12.9 delineate requirements specific to the\nrelationships between all third-party service providers (TPSPs) and their customers, and the responsibilities of both. This includes defining the specific services\nthe customer is receiving, along with which PCI DSS requirements are the responsibility of the customer to meet, which are the responsibility of the TPSP, and\nwhich requirements are shared between both customer and the TPSP.\nPayment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0.1 June 2024\n\u00a9 2006 - 2024 PCI Security Standards Council, LLC.

An entity is required to undergo an assessment according to this Appendix ONLY if instructed to do so by an acquirer or a\npayment brand. Examples of entities that this Appendix could apply to include:\n\u2022 Those storing, processing, and/or transmitting large volumes of account data,\n\u2022 Those providing aggregation points for account data, or\n\u2022 Those that have suffered significant or repeated breaches of account data.\nAdditionally, other PCI standards may reference completion of this Appendix.\nThese supplemental validation steps are intended to provide greater assurance that PCI DSS controls are maintained effectively and on a\ncontinuous basis through validation of business-as-usual (BAU) processes and increased validation and scoping consideration.\n(continued on next page)\nPayment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0.1 June 2024\n\u00a9 2006 - 2024 PCI Security Standards Council, LLC.

Page 346\n(continued)\nNote: Some PCI DSS requirements in this Appendix have defined timeframes (for example, an activity that is to be performed at least once\nevery three months or six months). For an initial assessment to such requirements, it is not required that an activity has been performed for\nevery such timeframe during the previous year, if the assessor verifies:\n\u2022 The activity was performed in accordance with the applicable requirement within the most recent timeframe (for example, the most recent\nthree-month or six-month period), and\n\u2022 The entity has documented policies and procedures for continuing to perform the activity within the defined timeframe.\nFor subsequent years after the initial assessment, an activity must have been performed within each required timeframe. For example, an\nactivity required at least every three months must have been performed at least four times during the previous year at an interval that does not\nexceed 90-92 days.\nRefer to section 7 Descriptions of Timeframes Used in PCI DSS Requirements for additional guidance about initial assessments.\nNot all requirements in PCI DSS apply to all entities that may undergo a PCI DSS assessment. It is for this reason that some PCI DSS\nRequirements are duplicated in this appendix.
